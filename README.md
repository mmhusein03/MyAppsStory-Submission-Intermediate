  This repository holds the source code for my project submissions during the <a href="https://www.dicoding.com/academies/352" target="_blank">Belajar Pengembangan Aplikasi Android Intermediate</a> course at Dicoding. It encompasses all submissions from the initial to the final stage. This course is part of my self-paced learning journey within the Bangkit 2023 Mobile Development track. Throughout this project, I strive to apply the best practices of Kotlin programming and the Android framework.
